## Introduction

HouseWork is designed to simplify and enhance the household chore management experience for families. Say goodbye to the days of messy chore lists and disorganized tasks. With HouseWork, you can effortlessly coordinate and track chores, ensuring everyone in your family is on the same page.

## Key Features

- **Onboarding**: Start by creating your family profile, including the family name and the names of each family member.
- **Task Management**: Organize chores seamlessly using a Kanban-style board with three columns: "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Enjoy real-time collaboration with your family members, making chore assignment and tracking a breeze.
- **Chore Details**: Dive into the specifics of each chore, such as due dates, descriptions, and assigned family members.
- **Firebase Integration**: Our backend, powered by Firebase, ensures data persistence and synchronization across devices.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Family Profile**: During the onboarding process, set up your family profile by providing the family name and names of each family member.

2. **Task Management**: Use the intuitive Kanban board on the home screen to manage chores. Simply drag and drop tasks between the "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" columns.

3. **Collaborate in Real Time**: Assign chores to family members and track progress collaboratively. Everyone stays in the loop, making chores a team effort.

4. **Chore Details**: Click on individual tasks to access detailed information. Update due dates, descriptions, and assigned family members with ease.

## Architecture

HouseWork is built upon a robust architecture that ensures scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns. We've adopted industry-standard best practices to create a clean and efficient codebase.

### Clean Architecture

Our application follows the principles of Clean Architecture, separating the codebase into distinct layers with well-defined responsibilities:

- **Presentation Layer**: This layer handles the user interface and user interactions. It includes Flutter widgets, screens, and presentation logic.

- **Domain Layer**: The heart of our application, the domain layer defines the core business logic and rules. It is entirely platform-independent and contains use cases and domain entities.

- **Data Layer**: Responsible for data retrieval and storage, the data layer interacts with external sources such as Firebase. It also includes repositories that provide a clean API for data access.

### Dependency Injection

We leverage the power of dependency injection to ensure modularity and testability in our code. We use the following libraries for dependency injection:

- **Get It**: Get It is a simple and efficient dependency injection library for Flutter. It allows us to easily manage and inject dependencies throughout our application, promoting loose coupling and testability.

- **Injectable**: Injectable is used to generate code for dependency injection. It works seamlessly with Get It, making it easy to configure and register dependencies in a type-safe manner.

### Separation of Concerns

To maintain a clean and organized codebase, we adhere to the separation of concerns principle. Each component of our application has a clearly defined role, reducing code complexity and enhancing maintainability.

Our commitment to clean architecture, dependency injection, and separation of concerns ensures that HouseWork is not only a powerful and efficient application but also a codebase that is easy to understand and extend.
